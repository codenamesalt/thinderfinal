            <h2>Our Website: Built with Modern Web Technologies</h2>
            <p>Our website was designed and developed using a robust combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MariaDB, and Apache software services. Here's a brief overview of how each technology played a role in bringing our vision to life:</p>
            <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
            <p>HTML forms the backbone of our website. It provides the basic structure and content of the web pages, allowing us to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Each page is crafted to ensure a solid foundation for our website's content and layout.</p>
            <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
            <p>CSS is used to style and visually enhance our website. With CSS, we define the look and feel of our web pages, ensuring a consistent and attractive design. It helps us control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics of the website, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript brings interactivity and dynamic content to our website. It allows us to create engaging user experiences by enabling features like form validation, dynamic content updates, and responsive elements. JavaScript ensures our website is not just static but interactive and engaging for users.</p>
            <h3>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)</h3>
            <p>PHP is the server-side scripting language that powers the backend of our website. It enables us to handle form submissions, interact with databases, and generate dynamic content. With PHP, we can manage user sessions, process data, and seamlessly integrate various functionalities into our web pages.</p>
            <h3>MariaDB</h3>
            <p>MariaDB is the database management system we use to store and manage our website's data. It ensures our data is organized, secure, and easily accessible. With MariaDB, we can perform efficient data queries and manage user information, content, and other essential data required for our website to function smoothly.</p>
            <h3>Apache</h3>
            <p>Apache is the web server software that hosts our website. It handles requests from users' browsers and serves the appropriate web pages. Apache ensures our website is reliable, scalable, and can handle multiple requests simultaneously, providing a seamless browsing experience for our users.</p>
            <p>By leveraging the power of these technologies, we have built a website that is not only functional and interactive but also scalable and easy to maintain.</p>
